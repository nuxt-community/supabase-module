title: Server route services
description: 'Learn how to use the Supabase module in your Nuxt 3 application.'

> This section assumes you're familiar with [Nitro](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/server-engine#standalone-server), the server engine powered by Nuxt.

In order to provide utilities similar to `vue` composables in [server routes](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/server-routes/), this module exposes services providing the same functionnalities.

### `serverSupabaseClient`

This function is working similary as the [useSupabaseClient](/usage/composables#usesupabaseclient) composable but is designed to be used in server routes.

Define your server route and just import the `serverSupabaseClient` from `#supabase/server`.

```ts [server/api/libraries.ts]
import { serverSupabaseClient } from '#supabase/server'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = serverSupabaseClient(event)

  const { data } = await client.from('librairies').select()

  return { librairies: data }
})
```

Then call your API route from any vue file:

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const fetchLibrairy = async () => {
  const { librairies } = await $fetch('/api/librairies')
}
```

Be careful, if you want to call this route on SSR, please read this [section](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/data-fetching/#isomorphic-fetch-and-fetch), you must send your browser cookies including your supabase token.

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const { data: { librairies }} = await useFetch('/api/librairies', {
  headers: useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])
})
```

### `serverSupabaseServiceRole`

This function is designed to work only on server side.

It works similary as the [serverSupabaseClient](/usage/services#serverSupabaseClient) but it provides a client with super admin rights that can bypass your Row Level Security.

> The client is initialized with the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` you must have in your `.env` file. Checkout the doc if you want to know more about [Supabase keys](https://supabase.com/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-deep-dive-jwts#jwts-in-supabase).

Define your server route and just import the `serverSupabaseServiceRole` from `#supabase/server`.

```ts [server/api/bypass-rls.ts]
import { serverSupabaseServiceRole } from '#supabase/server'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = serverSupabaseServiceRole(event)

  const { data } = await client.from('rls-protected-table').select()

  return { sensitiveData: data }
})
```

Then call your API route from any vue file:

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const fetchSensitiveData = async () => {
  const { sensitiveData } = await useFetch('/api/bypass-rls')
}
```

### `serverSupabaseUser`

This function is working similary as the [useSupabaseUser](/usage/composables#usesupabaseuser) composable but is designed to be used in server routes.

Define your server route and import the `serverSupabaseUser` from `#supabase/server`.

```ts [server/api/me.ts]
import { serverSupabaseUser } from '#supabase/server'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  return await serverSupabaseUser(event)
})
```

Then call your api route from any vue file:

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const user = ref(null)

const fetchMe = async () => {
   user.value = await $fetch('/api/me')
}
```

Be careful, if you want to call this route on SSR, please read this [section](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/data-fetching/#isomorphic-fetch-and-fetch), you must send your browser cookies including your supabase token.

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const user = ref(null)

const { data } = await useFetch('/api/me', {
  headers: useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])
})

user.value = data
```
